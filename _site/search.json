I care deeply about finding balance between work and life, ambition and rest. I like visiting museums, trying new foods, and dabbling in learning how to cook better and healthier. This space is a quiet place for reflection, curiosity, and whatever’s on my mind."

    "text": "The moment I boarded the plane to leave New York City for St. Louis, it felt like I was tearing a part of myself away. NYC had been my heartbeat, my home, my constant, my place of raw energy and endless possibility. I’d grown up in its streets, learned its rhythm, and thrived in its chaos. Leaving all that behind felt like stepping off a cliff into the unknown. New York wasn’t just a city; it was a feeling. It was the rush of walking down Broadway, the aroma of hand-pulled noodles wafting from the kitchens of Chinatown, the rumble of subway cars pulling into Grand Central, the quiet charm of art galleries in Chelsea, the flickering lights of Times Square after dark. It was the pizza on every corner, the endless events, the culture, the diversity. I could walk into any café, any bookstore, and feel a spark of inspiration. It was the place where I discovered myself, where I learned what I wanted out of life and out of a career.\nBut what really made New York home were the small, personal moments. I remember as a kid, running down the street with my friends at the first hint of warm weather, knowing that summer was around the corner. You could always tell by the sound, the unmistakable jingle of the Mr. Softee truck as it made its way down the block. And even when it wasn’t summer, when the cold made everyone else retreat inside, we’d still wait in line for that perfect vanilla cone with sprinkles. It wasn’t just about the ice cream; it was a part of the city’s pulse, a reminder that no matter the season, New York was alive and always moving forward. Those were the moments that made New York feel like home, and I didn’t realize how much I’d miss them until the day I had to leave.\nLeaving the city wasn’t just about moving away from the places I loved. It was about leaving a part of my identity behind, the part shaped by the energy of the streets, the sound of the subway, the smell of street food, and the feeling of being surrounded by millions of people, each with their own story. For someone who had spent their entire life in the city, moving away for medical school in the Midwest felt like I was stepping out of a world I had known my whole life and into one I had yet to understand. I remember the last few days before I left, walking around the city one last time. I’d pass the familiar places, the corner deli where I grabbed my bagel, the park where I used to walk and chat with my neighbor. Everything felt so alive, yet I couldn’t help but feel a sense of finality. The thought of leaving it all behind weighed heavily on me. How could I leave the place that had shaped so much of who I am? But as I stood there, I realized that leaving wasn’t really goodbye. It was a “see you later.” Because in a city like New York, you never truly leave. A part of it stays with you, woven into your DNA, pulsing through your memories, echoing in the sounds of the streets. New York doesn’t forget you, and you don’t forget New York. It’s a place that keeps you grounded, that reminds you where you came from, no matter how far you travel.\nThe plane ride that followed was surreal. As the city shrank beneath me, I felt an overwhelming sense of loss. It wasn’t just the physical distance that felt daunting; it was the emotional space between me and the city that had been my home. But as the plane soared farther away, I knew that this wasn’t the end. It was just a new beginning, a journey that would push me in ways I never imagined, as I transitioned from the familiar chaos of NYC to the quieter, slower pace of life in the Midwest for medical school. New York had given me more than I could ever express in words. But now, it was time to carry the lessons it taught me, about resilience, about diversity, about never backing down, into the next chapter of my life. The city’s energy will always live inside me, helping me grow and pushing me to reach for my dreams.\nAnd while the jingle of the Mr. Softee truck may not echo through the streets of St. Louis, the spirit of New York, its strength, its diversity, its unyielding pace, will always be with me. It’s not goodbye. It’s just a “see you later.” Because no matter where I go, New York will always be my home."

    "text": "Being a CNA was an invaluable experience that enabled me to be both a caregiver and a friend to people who are among the most vulnerable in society. What started as a simple step toward gaining clinical experience for my medical school application quickly became a an eye-opening experience that reshaped my perception of what providing care means. When I first walked into the dementia unit of the nursing home, I thought I knew what I was getting into. After all, I had taken a class and gotten certified to become a CNA, specifically to gain hands-on experience. But nothing could have prepared me for the lessons I would learn about patience, empathy, and resilience.\n“Lulu” was one of the first residents I cared for. With her being the only Mandarin speaker on the floor and me being the only CNA working that floor who spoke Mandarin, we quickly developed a bond. Every shift, during lunchtime, Lulu and I would chat after I finished feeding other residents. She loved telling me stories about her family and showing me pictures of her grandchildren, remarking each time that I reminded her of her granddaughter. One afternoon, upon walking into Lulu’s room, I noticed her untouched lunch and her body slouched over. I instantly knew something was wrong. Grabbing her chest, Lulu told me that she was having chest pain and could not move without her back hurting. She asked me to bring her to a doctor and communicate her complaints to the doctor. Assuring Lulu that I would be back, I hurried to the nurse and prompted her to transfer Lulu to an ED for medical care. When I returned the following week, I learned that Lulu was still in the hospital but had received the help she needed in a timely manner, due to my intervention. Lulu inspires me to always fight for those who desperately need advocates in the healthcare system, especially non-native English speakers, so they are heard and their health concerns are addressed.\nEach day on the dementia unit brought a mix of exhaustion, small joys, and deep reflection. I was working with people who had lost so much: memories, independence, clarity. Yet they taught me more than any textbook ever could. From the smallest gestures of connection to fleeting moments of recognition, every experience reminded me why I want to be in medicine."

    "text": "There were nights during my first year of medical school when I seriously wondered what it would be like to walk away.\nNot in a dramatic sense. Just…leave. Step off the treadmill and do something simpler. Something with regular hours. Something where my evenings and weekends weren’t consumed by lectures, prereadings, and the constant feeling that I was behind. I’d think about the version of me who could’ve gone back to retail, who liked fashion and once worked at Aritzia, who could’ve networked and maybe worked her way up in that world. Or the part of me that might’ve gone into teaching. Who maybe could’ve been happy there. Or at least free.\nI had those conversations with people in my life more than once. “What if I left?” I’d ask. Not always seriously, but not as a joke either. Just trying to imagine a different life, one with breathing room. Medical school is marketed as this clean, upward path. But the first year felt messy. Disorienting. The volume of content, the mental exhaustion, the emotional isolation, it was nothing like the dream I clung to as a premed. There were days I couldn’t see past the stress and wondered if I’d made a huge mistake. Days when all I wanted was a 9 to 5 and the ability to make weekend plans without guilt. But for every low, there were moments that reminded me why I was here. Learning how to read an EKG, understanding how a disease progresses, and how to treat it, realizing I could explain what was actually happening in someone’s body, and that it made sense, was a turning point. Practicing taking patient histories and diving deeper into the different organ systems added another layer of meaning. I wasn’t just memorizing anymore; I was beginning to think like a clinician. That realization hit me hard, and it made me realize that this was the tradeoff: I gave up freedom for meaning, comfort for a chance to do something that mattered to me. Some days, that choice still feels brutal. But on the days it clicks, when the material feels real and alive and worth it, it’s enough to keep going. I’m not writing this from the other side yet. I’m still in it, still tired, still asking questions. But I’ve learned that doubt doesn’t mean you’re doing it wrong; sometimes, it just means you’re paying attention."

    "text": "We met in high school at one of those afterschool events that didn’t matter much, except that it brought me to you. I don’t even remember what the event was for, only that we clicked almost instantly. We grew close fast. You were sharp, so funny it caught people off guard, but underneath that humor there was a weight I came to know more about with time. You told me in fragments: the abuse from your father, the absence of your mother, the feeling that you had to carry things alone. We were just teenagers with our own battles. I didn’t always know what to say, but I listened. I stayed. I loved you like a sister. We’d pass memes in class, joke about teachers, send voice notes late at night. You made the pain a little easier to talk about just by being you.\nAfter high school, we started to drift. I went to Fordham; you enrolled at NYU. We were still in the same city, but it felt like we were living in different orbits. Life moved fast. Premed classes, exams, everything piling up. There were a few missed calls, a few texts I meant to answer but didn’t. I told myself I’d get to them later, that you’d understand. Then, after some time, you reached out again. You said things weren’t good, that it felt heavy again. I told you I was here, that I always would be. You said you just needed space. You sounded tired. And I didn’t hear from you again.\nIt wasn’t until senior year of college that I got a message from your sister asking if I wanted to attend your funeral. I haven’t heard from her in ages, not since the high school days where you and I would have sleepovers, and she would join. I remember staring at my phone, reading it over and over, not believing what I was seeing. That was how I found out. That was how I lost you. Grief didn’t hit all at once. It came in waves, in the quiet moments. I’d be on the subway or walking to class and suddenly feel like I couldn’t breathe. I kept replaying everything; our last texts, our high school jokes, our time as Bayside’s cheerleaders. I thought about what I should’ve done, what I could’ve said, whether any of it would’ve made a difference.\nSince losing you, I’ve started reaching out more. I check in, even when it feels awkward, even when people say they’re fine. Especially then. You taught me that people can be smiling and still silently breaking. That pain isn’t always loud. That support doesn’t always come from having the right words, but from staying, from showing up. I think about you often, in ways I don’t always say out loud. I carry your story with me; when I ask better questions, when I sit with someone’s sadness, when I choose to stay present even in discomfort. You were one of my first lessons in how deeply people can hurt and how much it matters to be seen in that hurt.\nThere’s so much I wish I could go back and do differently. But more than anything, I’m grateful I got to know you at all."
