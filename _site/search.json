    "text": "I’m 23, born and raised in New York City, and currently in medical school. I write to remind myself to slow down, notice things, and make sense of them. I care deeply about finding balance between work and life, ambition and rest. I like visiting museums, trying new foods, and dabbling in learning how to cook better and healthier. This space is a quiet place for reflection, curiosity, and whatever’s on my mind."

    "text": "Being a CNA was an invaluable experience that enabled me to be both a caregiver and a friend to people who are among the most vulnerable in society. What started as a simple step toward gaining clinical experience for my medical school application quickly became a an eye-opening experience that reshaped my perception of what providing care means. When I first walked into the dementia unit of the nursing home, I thought I knew what I was getting into. After all, I had taken a class and gotten certified to become a CNA, specifically to gain hands-on experience. But nothing could have prepared me for the lessons I would learn about patience, empathy, and resilience.\n“Lulu” was one of the first residents I cared for. With her being the only Mandarin speaker on the floor and me being the only CNA working that floor who spoke Mandarin, we quickly developed a bond. Every shift, during lunchtime, Lulu and I would chat after I finished feeding other residents. She loved telling me stories about her family and showing me pictures of her grandchildren, remarking each time that I reminded her of her granddaughter. One afternoon, upon walking into Lulu’s room, I noticed her untouched lunch and her body slouched over. I instantly knew something was wrong. Grabbing her chest, Lulu told me that she was having chest pain and could not move without her back hurting. She asked me to bring her to a doctor and communicate her complaints to the doctor. Assuring Lulu that I would be back, I hurried to the nurse and prompted her to transfer Lulu to an ED for medical care. When I returned the following week, I learned that Lulu was still in the hospital but had received the help she needed in a timely manner, due to my intervention. Lulu inspires me to always fight for those who desperately need advocates in the healthcare system, especially non-native English speakers, so they are heard and their health concerns are addressed.\nEach day on the dementia unit brought a mix of exhaustion, small joys, and deep reflection. I was working with people who had lost so much: memories, independence, clarity. Yet they taught me more than any textbook ever could. From the smallest gestures of connection to fleeting moments of recognition, every experience reminded me why I want to be in medicine."

    "text": "The moment I boarded the plane to leave New York City for medical school, it felt like I was tearing a part of myself away. NYC had been my heartbeat, my home, my constant, my place of raw energy and endless possibility. I’d grown up in its streets, learned its rhythm, and thrived in its chaos. Leaving all that behind felt like stepping off a cliff into the unknown. New York wasn’t just a city; it was a feeling. It was the rush of walking down a crowded street, the hum of subway cars, the flickering lights of Times Square after dark. It was the pizza on every corner, the endless events, the culture, the diversity. I could walk into any café, any bookstore, and feel a spark of inspiration. It was the place where I discovered myself, where I learned what I wanted out of life and out of a career.\nBut what really made New York home were the small, personal moments. I remember as a kid, running down the street with my friends at the first hint of warm weather, knowing that summer was around the corner. You could always tell by the sound, the unmistakable jingle of the Mr. Softee truck as it made its way down the block. And even when it wasn’t summer, when the cold made everyone else retreat inside, we’d still wait in line for that perfect vanilla cone with sprinkles. It wasn’t just about the ice cream; it was a part of the city’s pulse, a reminder that no matter the season, New York was alive and always moving forward. Those were the moments that made New York feel like home, and I didn’t realize how much I’d miss them until the day I had to leave.\nLeaving the city wasn’t just about moving away from the places I loved. It was about leaving a part of my identity behind, the part shaped by the energy of the streets, the sound of the subway, the smell of street food, and the feeling of being surrounded by millions of people, each with their own story. For someone who had spent their entire life in the city, moving away for medical school in the Midwest felt like I was stepping out of a world I had known my whole life and into one I had yet to understand. I remember the last few days before I left, walking around the city one last time. I’d pass the familiar places, the corner deli where I grabbed my bagel, the park where I used to walk and chat with my neighbor. Everything felt so alive, yet I couldn’t help but feel a sense of finality. The thought of leaving it all behind weighed heavily on me. How could I leave the place that had shaped so much of who I am? But as I stood there, I realized that leaving wasn’t really goodbye. It was a “see you later.” Because in a city like New York, you never truly leave. A part of it stays with you, woven into your DNA, pulsing through your memories, echoing in the sounds of the streets. New York doesn’t forget you, and you don’t forget New York. It’s a place that keeps you grounded, that reminds you where you came from, no matter how far you travel.\nThe plane ride that followed was surreal. As the city shrank beneath me, I felt a twinge of sadness. It wasn’t just the physical distance that felt daunting; it was the emotional space between me and the city that had been my home. But as the plane soared farther away, I knew that this wasn’t the end. It was just a new beginning, a journey that would push me in ways I never imagined, as I transitioned from the familiar chaos of NYC to the quieter, slower pace of life in the Midwest for medical school. New York had given me more than I could ever express in words. But now, it was time to carry the lessons it taught me, about resilience, about diversity, about never backing down, into the next chapter of my life. The city’s energy will always live inside me, helping me grow and pushing me to reach for my dreams.\nAnd while the jingle of the Mr. Softee truck may not echo through the streets of St. Louis, the spirit of New York, its strength, its diversity, its unyielding pace, will always be with me. It’s not goodbye. It’s just a “see you later.” Because no matter where I go, a part of New York will always be my home."
