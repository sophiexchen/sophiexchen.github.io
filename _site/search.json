    "text": "I’m 23, born and raised in New York City, and currently in medical school. I write to remind myself to slow down, notice things, and make sense of them. I care deeply about finding balance between work and life, ambition and rest. I like visiting museums, trying new foods, and dabbling in learning how to cook better and healthier. This space is a quiet place for reflection, curiosity, and whatever’s on my mind."
