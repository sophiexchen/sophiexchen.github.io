This space is a quiet place for reflection, curiosity, and whatever’s on my mind."

    "text": "There were nights during my first year of medical school when I seriously wondered what it would be like to walk away. Not in a dramatic sense. Just…leave. Step off the treadmill and do something simpler. Something with regular hours. Something where my evenings and weekends weren’t consumed by lectures, prereadings, and the constant feeling that I was behind. I’d think about the version of me who could’ve gone back to retail, who liked fashion and once worked at Aritzia, who could’ve networked and maybe worked her way up in that world. Or the part of me that might’ve gone into teaching. Who maybe could’ve been happy there. Or at least free.\nI had those conversations with people in my life more than once. “What if I left?” I’d ask. Not always seriously, but not as a joke either. Just trying to imagine a different life, one with breathing room. Medical school is marketed as this clean, upward path. But the first year felt messy. Disorienting. The volume of content, the mental exhaustion, the emotional isolation, it was nothing like the dream I clung to as a premed. There were days I couldn’t see past the stress and wondered if I’d made a huge mistake. Days when all I wanted was a 9 to 5 and the ability to make weekend plans without guilt.\nBut for every low, there were moments that reminded me why I was here. Learning how to read an EKG, understanding how a disease progresses, and how to treat it, realizing I could explain what was actually happening in someone’s body, and that it made sense, was a turning point. Practicing taking patient histories and diving deeper into the different organ systems added another layer of meaning. I wasn’t just memorizing anymore; I was beginning to think like a clinician. That realization hit me hard, and it made me realize that this was the tradeoff: I gave up freedom for meaning, comfort for a chance to do something that mattered to me. Some days, that choice still feels brutal. But on the days it clicks, when the material feels real and alive and worth it, it’s enough to keep going. I’m not writing this from the other side yet. I’m still in it, still tired, still asking questions. But I’ve learned that doubt doesn’t mean you’re doing it wrong; sometimes, it just means you’re paying attention."

    "text": "As I close out my first year of medical school, I find myself less captivated by lectures and more enthralled by moments of clarity on the dementia floor: a woman’s eyes brightening as jazz music crackled from our old boombox; a Huntington’s patient’s shoulders loosening as she followed the slow rhythm of our seated arm exercises; an Alzheimer’s mind pausing over a familiar photograph. Dementia, Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s are often reduced to broken circuitry, but I see real people craving dignity and connection.\nMy fascination began back when I worked as a CNA, feeding residents, helping them shower, changing them, and learning to recognize the person behind the diagnosis. I remember one resident in particular: she would scratch or claw at most of the staff, but whenever I came in to feed her she would settle quietly, almost as if she knew I was there to care, not just to complete a task. The nurses made it a running joke between them, telling me I was the only CNA she did not try to push away. In those moments, I felt not only useful but deeply connected, like I could reach someone where words and memories failed. When I learned to interpret her nonverbal cues, I realized that patients often speak through their posture, facial expressions, and small gestures, and that recognizing these signals is just as critical as any history I’ll take as a doctor.\nThere was also E, a sweet woman with no family who always sat in the corner of the dayroom, close to the sink. She never let go of her robotic therapy cat, one of those models that meowed when you pressed its button, and she would pet it and meow right back. When I offered her coloring sheets and crayons, her eyes would glisten as she filled every page perfectly within the lines. I often found myself wondering if she had once been an artist or had another creative career. Though I never asked, in those quiet moments I felt we shared something meaningful.\nAnd then there was P, a Spanish-speaking resident who greeted me with “Hola, niña linda” every time I walked through the door. I would reply in my shaky high-school Spanish, sometimes leaning on Google Translate, with “tú linda,” and her grin would fill the room. We would spend unhurried minutes trying to solve a puzzle and trading simple phrases in Spanish until she drifted back into her afternoon routine. My exchanges with P reminded me that connection does not require perfect language, only genuine warmth and curiosity.\nThese experiences taught me that treating people with dementia is not just about managing symptoms or prescribing medications but also about finding small ways to light up their world. Whether it be playing a familiar song, creating a structured routine, adjusting lighting to calm sundown confusion, or handing residents a simple coloring book, these small acts bring flickers of recognition. While my interests may evolve as I progress through my medical training, the lessons I’ve learned from these early encounters, about dignity, patience, and presence, will remain central to the physician I hope to become. Right now, I feel most drawn to working with geriatric patients living with dementia and learning how to bring light to their world, one small gesture at a time."

    "text": "The moment I boarded the plane to leave New York City for St. Louis, it felt like I was tearing a part of myself away. NYC had been my heartbeat, my home, my constant, my place of raw energy and endless possibility. I’d grown up in its streets, learned its rhythm, and thrived in its chaos. Leaving all that behind felt like stepping off a cliff into the unknown. New York wasn’t just a city; it was a feeling. It was the rush of walking down Broadway, the aroma of hand-pulled noodles wafting from the kitchens of Chinatown, the rumble of subway cars pulling into Grand Central, the quiet charm of art galleries in Chelsea, the flickering lights of Times Square after dark. It was the pizza on every corner, the endless events, the culture, the diversity. I could walk into any café, any bookstore, and feel a spark of inspiration. It was the place where I discovered myself, where I learned what I wanted out of life and out of a career.\nBut what really made New York home were the small, personal moments. I remember as a kid, running down the street with my friends at the first hint of warm weather, knowing that summer was around the corner. You could always tell by the sound, the unmistakable jingle of the Mr. Softee truck as it made its way down the block. And even when it wasn’t summer, when the cold made everyone else retreat inside, we’d still wait in line for that perfect vanilla cone with sprinkles. It wasn’t just about the ice cream; it was a part of the city’s pulse, a reminder that no matter the season, New York was alive and always moving forward. Those were the moments that made New York feel like home, and I didn’t realize how much I’d miss them until the day I had to leave.\nLeaving the city wasn’t just about moving away from the places I loved. It was about leaving a part of my identity behind, the part shaped by the energy of the streets, the sound of the subway, the smell of street food, and the feeling of being surrounded by millions of people, each with their own story. For someone who had spent their entire life in the city, moving away for medical school in the Midwest felt like I was stepping out of a world I had known my whole life and into one I had yet to understand. I remember the last few days before I left, walking around the city one last time. I’d pass the familiar places, the corner deli where I grabbed my bagel, the park where I used to walk and chat with my neighbor. Everything felt so alive, yet I couldn’t help but feel a sense of finality. The thought of leaving it all behind weighed heavily on me. How could I leave the place that had shaped so much of who I am? But as I stood there, I realized that leaving wasn’t really goodbye. It was a “see you later.” Because in a city like New York, you never truly leave. A part of it stays with you, woven into your DNA, pulsing through your memories, echoing in the sounds of the streets. New York doesn’t forget you, and you don’t forget New York. It’s a place that keeps you grounded, that reminds you where you came from, no matter how far you travel.\nThe plane ride that followed was surreal. As the city shrank beneath me, I felt an overwhelming sense of loss. It wasn’t just the physical distance that felt daunting; it was the emotional space between me and the city that had been my home. But as the plane soared farther away, I knew that this wasn’t the end. It was just a new beginning, a journey that would push me in ways I never imagined, as I transitioned from the familiar chaos of NYC to the quieter, slower pace of life in the Midwest for medical school. New York had given me more than I could ever express in words. But now, it was time to carry the lessons it taught me, about resilience, about diversity, about never backing down, into the next chapter of my life. The city’s energy will always live inside me, helping me grow and pushing me to reach for my dreams.\nAnd while the jingle of the Mr. Softee truck may not echo through the streets of St. Louis, the spirit of New York, its strength, its diversity, its unyielding pace, will always be with me. It’s not goodbye. It’s just a “see you later.” Because no matter where I go, New York will always be my home."

    "text": "People slip into all kinds of roles in daily life: the planner, the dreamer, the overthinker, the snack-getter. Recently, though, I have been thinking about a different pair of archetypes: the toad and the swan. At first glance, it sounds like an insult disguised as zoology. One creature is earthy, lumpy, and entirely uninterested in optics. The other glides around looking like it charges admission to be perceived. One gets compared to damp moss; the other to balletic poetry.\nI grew up being shown I was the swan. My mother curated that identity with almost artistic precision. When I was seven, she gave me a Swarovski swan necklace that sparkled like a tiny declaration of who I was supposed to become. During the holiday season, I would visit the New York City Ballet to see Swan Lake, where the dancers glided across the stage as if they were made of light and discipline and I absorbed the message without anyone needing to say a word. She made sure I understood that a girl should be put together. Presentation was a skill. Poise was a responsibility. Being polished was nonnegotiable. So now, in my twenties, I get my nails done with ritual consistency. I dress with intention. I care about fashion not out of vanity, but because it feels like a fluent language I have spoken since childhood. Elegance was the blueprint I was handed.\nBut here’s the twist: being the toad is wildly underrated. Toads have mythology on their side. In fairytales, they are the ones who transform; humble beginnings, surprising endings. Swans do not get character development. They enter elegant and leave elegant. Good for them, but predictable. The toad, however, is the creature that shocks everyone. It simply exists comfortably and confidently, often covered in mud. There is freedom in that kind of self-possession; the world can underestimate you, and you lose absolutely nothing. Meanwhile, swans look serene but are famously neurotic. One loud noise and they’re ready to file a complaint with the universe. Symbolically, the toad has grit. It’s built for weather, for change, for seasons that aren’t curated. A swan is beautiful, yes, but more delicate than its PR team would ever admit. A toad can outlast a swan in just about any scenario except a dramatic lake photo shoot. Everything it has, including its humor, resilience, and actual charm, comes from substance. Swans can dazzle from afar, but they rarely surprise you. A toad can. So if life ever casts you as the toad, don’t fight it. I grew up raised as the swan, taught to glide, taught to sparkle, taught to be put together. And I still love beauty. I still love polish. But there is something far more interesting about the creature people underestimate: the one that is unpolished, unbothered, unafraid, and entirely uninterested in performing for approval. The toad is the one with the story arc, the unexpected punchline, the personality. The toad endures; the toad adapts; the toad sometimes even poisons those who get too close, which, frankly, is a talent the swan could never pull off. And honestly? It is better to be underestimated than to be ornamental."

    "text": "When I think of my grandfather, I don’t see a hospital room or the word “cancer.” I see a small courtyard in Fuzhou, where the late afternoon sun painted the walls golden, and a full-grown man crouched beside a tricycle, patiently guiding my four-year-old self as I pedaled for the very first time. I was born in New York City, but with my parents busy working, they sent me back to Fuzhou almost immediately. My grandparents on my mother’s side were the first to truly raise me. He spoke in our soft Fuzhounese dialect, laughter in his voice, promising I’d be racing past the neighborhood kids in no time. That moment, wheel against cobblestone, his steady hand on the back, was the first of many ways he taught me how to find balance in a new world. Every evening, as the sky turned lavender, grandfather would hum “老鼠爱大米” (“Mice Love Rice”). His voice cracked a little on the high notes, but he’d lean close and let me trace each Chinese character in the steam rising from my bowl of congee. That silly song, about tiny mice scurrying for grains, became our secret lullaby. Even now, years later, whenever I hear that melody, I can almost feel his rough, warm palm smoothing the hair off my forehead.\nAround the age of five, I boarded a plane from Fuzhou to New York, returning to the bright lights of the city that my parents called home to begin pre-K. Grandfather stayed behind in Fujian province, and our lives stretched across oceans. I learned English faster than I learned to cook rice; he learned to wait by the phone, knowing my mother would call from the States and hand it to me.\nYears later, while I was eating breakfast, my mother sat beside me and told me that grandfather’s cancer had taken a turn. I was stunned; up until that morning, my mother had kept his diagnosis from me. At the time, I was still too young to even understand what cancer was, but old enough to know he was very sick by the worry etched on her face and the weight it carried in her voice. She flew back to Fuzhou for his funeral, while my dad stayed behind, balancing his job and two kids. I couldn’t be on the plane due to school.\nBut through international calls and blurred video calls, grandfather’s last lesson revealed itself: love can span continents, survive silence, and outlast even the hardest goodbyes. I’ll never sing “老鼠爱大米” quite the same way, and that’s how I know he’s still with me, in every lyric that slips through my lips and in every wobble-to-steady-ride moment I face. Writing this isn’t about cancer statistics or fundraising links; it’s about a grandfather whose simple acts, singing, steadying my tricycle, fed my courage and shaped my heart. The song isn’t just any song; it’s a reminder of where I come from and what I’m capable of. And so, I’ll carry his resilience, quiet strength, teachings, and warmth wherever life’s next road takes me."

    "text": "We met in high school at one of those afterschool events that didn’t matter much, except that it brought me to you. I don’t even remember what the event was for, only that we clicked almost instantly. We grew close fast. You were sharp, so funny it caught people off guard, but underneath that humor there was a weight I came to know more about with time. You told me in fragments: the abuse from your father, the absence of your mother, the feeling that you had to carry things alone. We were just teenagers with our own battles. I didn’t always know what to say, but I listened. I stayed. I loved you like a sister. We’d pass memes in class, joke about teachers, send voice notes late at night. You made the pain a little easier to talk about just by being you.\nAfter high school, we started to drift. I went to Fordham; you enrolled at NYU. We were still in the same city, but it felt like we were living in different orbits. Life moved fast. Premed classes, exams, everything piling up. There were a few missed calls, a few texts I meant to answer but didn’t. I told myself I’d get to them later, that you’d understand. Then, after some time, you reached out again. You said things weren’t good, that it felt heavy again. I told you I was here, that I always would be. You said you just needed space. You sounded tired. And I didn’t hear from you again.\nIt wasn’t until senior year of college that I got a message from your sister asking if I wanted to attend your funeral. I hadn’t heard from her in ages, not since the high school days where you and I would have sleepovers, and she would join. I remember staring at my phone, reading it over and over, not believing what I was seeing. That was how I found out. That was how I lost you. Grief didn’t hit all at once. It came in waves, in the quiet moments. I’d be on the subway or walking to class and suddenly feel like I couldn’t breathe. I kept replaying everything; our last texts, our high school jokes, our time as Bayside’s cheerleaders. I thought about what I should’ve done, what I could’ve said, whether any of it would’ve made a difference.\nSince losing you, I’ve started reaching out more. I check in, even when it feels awkward, even when people say they’re fine. Especially then. You taught me that people can be smiling and still silently breaking. That pain isn’t always loud. That support doesn’t always come from having the right words, but from staying, from showing up. I think about you often, in ways I don’t always say out loud. I carry your story with me; when I ask better questions, when I sit with someone’s sadness, when I choose to stay present even in discomfort. You were one of my first lessons in how deeply people can hurt and how much it matters to be seen in that hurt. There’s so much I wish I could go back and do differently. But more than anything, I’m grateful I got to know you at all."

    "text": "Being a CNA was an invaluable experience that enabled me to be both a caregiver and a friend to people who are among the most vulnerable in society. What started as a simple step toward gaining clinical experience for my medical school application quickly became a an eye-opening experience that reshaped my perception of what providing care means. When I first walked into the dementia unit of the nursing home, I thought I knew what I was getting into. After all, I had taken a class and gotten certified to become a CNA, specifically to gain hands-on experience. But nothing could have prepared me for the lessons I would learn about patience, empathy, and resilience.\n“Lulu” was one of the first residents I cared for. With her being the only Mandarin speaker on the floor and me being the only CNA working that floor who spoke Mandarin, we quickly developed a bond. Every shift, during lunchtime, Lulu and I would chat after I finished feeding other residents. She loved telling me stories about her family and showing me pictures of her grandchildren, remarking each time that I reminded her of her granddaughter. One afternoon, upon walking into Lulu’s room, I noticed her untouched lunch and her body slouched over. I instantly knew something was wrong. Grabbing her chest, Lulu told me that she was having chest pain and could not move without her back hurting. She asked me to bring her to a doctor and communicate her complaints to the doctor. Assuring Lulu that I would be back, I hurried to the nurse and prompted her to transfer Lulu to an ED for medical care. When I returned the following week, I learned that Lulu was still in the hospital but had received the help she needed in a timely manner, due to my intervention. Lulu inspires me to always fight for those who desperately need advocates in the healthcare system, especially non-native English speakers, so they are heard and their health concerns are addressed.\nEach day on the dementia unit brought a mix of exhaustion, small joys, and deep reflection. I was working with people who had lost so much: memories, independence, clarity. Yet they taught me more than any textbook ever could. From the smallest gestures of connection to fleeting moments of recognition, every experience reminded me why I want to be in medicine."
